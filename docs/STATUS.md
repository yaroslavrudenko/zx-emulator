# Status

A living record of where the project actually is — what is proven, what is measured, what is
open. Updated as work lands, not once at the start.

## Milestone M1 — Z80 core, un-prefixed opcodes

### Proven

| | |
|---|---|
| **FUSE conformance, un-prefixed** | **290 / 290 pass** |
| Divergence in T-state totals, `PC`, `R`, `I`, `IFF1/2`, `IM`, memory, or any register but `AF` | **none** |
| Crate tests | 36 lib + doctests, green in dev **and** release (`overflow-checks = true`) |
| `clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `fmt`, `cargo doc` | clean, 0 warnings |
| Out of M1 scope, counted not ignored | 1045 prefixed vectors — `DD` 343, `FD` 341, `CB` 264, `ED` 97 |

Two defects were found by the oracle and fixed. Both now carry regression tests that were
**proven to go red** on the original defect before being trusted:

- The `AluOp` table had `Or` and `Xor` transposed. The hardware field encodes `101`=XOR,
  `110`=OR. Caught by vector `af`: `XOR A` must yield `0x00` and returned `A | A`.
- `DAA` suppressed the magnitude corrections on the `N=1` path. The rule — in this repo's own
  `Z80-REFERENCE.md` — applies on both paths; only the direction differs.

The second one is why an external oracle earns its keep: the wrong behaviour was defended by a
plausible comment and would have shipped.

### Measured

See *Measured* in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md). Headline: **507× real-time** on a flat
bus, **294×** on a bus shaped the way M7 will be — 0.34 % of a frame budget. The performance
policy stays "optimise nothing", now backed by a number rather than an assumption.

### Hardening round — what a cold review found after the oracle was green

290/290 said the arithmetic was right. It said nothing about four decisions frozen in the public
API, which is what a reviewer is for. All are now implemented; the trace gate is what proves the
first one stays fixed.

| Item | Why it mattered | State |
|---|---|---|
| `Bus::tick` batched machine cycles and carried no address | Batching discards **88 of the corpus's 166** internal contention points. And the machine can track its own transfers but can never learn `IR` — which is what sits on the bus during the internal cycles of `ADD HL,ss`, `JR`, `DJNZ`, `CALL`, `PUSH` | fixed; trace asserted |
| No way to accept an interrupt | `interrupt()` / `nmi()` did not exist, and `set_state` cannot write memory or tick the bus, so there was no route out of `HALT`. M5 could not have booted | fixed; `halted` now drives `step()` and the acceptance rule lives in one place |
| `set_state` left `ei_pending` stale | A snapshot loaded just after `EI` dropped that frame's interrupt | fixed |
| `WZ` / `Q` absent from `CpuState` | Adding public fields is free with zero consumers and breaking with one | fixed; the `Q` plumbing landed, the rule waits for `zexall` |
| `hl_base` unbuilt | Decision 2's central mechanism | fixed; `base` threaded, so `DD 29` becomes `ADD IX,IX` with no new code |

Three findings the corpus produced that no amount of reading the spec would have: `RST`'s
internal cycle sits on `IR` while `CALL`'s sits on the last operand address, though both share
one handler; and `DJNZ` uses two different addresses in one instruction.

### Open — the authoritative register

This table is the single source for what is open. `ARCHITECTURE.md` links here and does not
duplicate it: the two were briefly kept in parallel and disagreed about four facts within one
session, which is the same failure mode that let the `tick` contract survive unchallenged.

| Item | State | Settled by |
|---|---|---|
| `Q` latch | Plumbing landed — `write_flags` is the single F writer, `q` cleared per step. The **rule** is not implemented; `SCF`/`CCF` use `F3/F5 = A & 0x28` | **M4, `zexall`.** FUSE's single-instruction vectors structurally cannot decide it: Q is defined by an instruction *sequence*. The two contested cases are `POP AF` and `EX AF,AF'` |
| `WZ` / MEMPTR | Carried in `CpuState`, never written | M4, when `BIT n,(HL)` first makes it observable |
| Resolved-target refactor | `read_operand`, `write_operand` and `tick_read_modify_delay` each recompute `pair(base)` independently. Free for `(HL)`; for `(IX+d)` the displacement must be fetched once and the addition charged once | **M2's opening move.** Needs a `Register(RegIndex) \| Memory(u16)` computed once and threaded |
| `Cpu<B: Bus>` struct-level bound | Downstream types naming `Cpu<Ula>` must carry `where Ula: Bus`; the fields need no bound to be well-formed | Removable at any time — non-breaking, but touches every signature written meanwhile |
| M1 fetch vs operand read | The machine cannot tell an M1 opcode fetch from an operand read; both arrive as `Bus::read` | Not blocking. Contention depends on address and `t mod 8`, both of which the machine has. A defaulted `fn fetch(&mut self, addr) -> u8 { self.read(addr) }` is non-breaking whenever a debugger or a precise floating-bus model wants it |
| Contention within a cycle | Only cycle *starts* are pinned; nothing asserts the address holds constant across a cycle's remaining T-states. It does — but by implementation, not by gate | One assertion over `tick_addresses` between consecutive transfers, if it earns its place |

### Where the corpus is not an oracle

FUSE elides the operand read on a not-taken `JP cc` / `JR cc` / `DJNZ`. The core reads them, and
the harness carries a **documented exception list** naming each vector.

The core is right, on five independent grounds: Zilog documents `JP cc,nn` with a **single** cycle
count (10 T) where `CALL cc` and `RET cc` have two, and a machine cycle that does not happen
changes the count; `PC` still advances by 3, and on the Z80 `PC` increments as part of the
operand-fetch cycle; MEMPTR sets `WZ = nn` regardless of the condition, which is a hardware
measurement from `BIT n,(HL)` experiments rather than documentation, and `WZ` cannot be loaded
from bytes never read; the corpus treats `CALL cc` — where the machine cycles genuinely differ —
identically to `JP cc`, where they do not, which is the signature of a bookkeeping convention; and
this crate's own doc comment on `jump_conditional` said so before the code did.

The general rule this establishes: **the core models the Z80, the harness models the corpus,
including its limitations.** Bending the core to match an emulator's bookkeeping would be fitting,
not fixing.

### Deliberately not changed

Recorded so they are not re-litigated:

- `#[allow(dead_code)]` on `flags::prefixed` is correct. `#[expect]` was tested and **breaks**
  the `-D warnings` gate: under `cfg(test)` every item is used, so the expectation goes
  unfulfilled and is promoted to an error.
- `Operand::register_index`'s `match` compiles to an 11-instruction cascade. Both proposed
  replacements trade compile-time exhaustiveness for ~10 instructions against 500× headroom.
- Big-endian pair storage costs ~2 instructions per 16-bit access. Priced, deliberate, kept —
  flipping it would be a large cosmetic diff for no measurable gain.

## How this project is verified

Three tiers, and the distinction between them is the point:

1. **An external oracle decides correctness.** FUSE vectors now, `zexdoc` at M3, `zexall` at
   M4. Not opinion, not self-assessment — `OK` or not.
2. **Regression tests must be proven to bite.** A test that does not go red on the original
   defect is decoration. Every mutation is verified to have *landed in the file* before its
   verdict is trusted, because a failed edit and an unbreakable guard produce the same exit code.
3. **Claims about the emitted code are checked in the emitted code.** "It monomorphises" and
   "it lowers to a jump table" are assertions until someone reads the assembly.

Machine-level timing (contention, floating bus) has no such oracle and is verified against
known-demanding software. That is observation, and it is labelled as observation.

## Next — M2, costed

The 1045 prefixed vectors were run once as reconnaissance. **1043 fail**, and the shape of the
failures turns "implement four prefixes" into a sequence:

| Category | CB | DD | ED | FD | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| decode (fault) | 264 | 341 | 89 | 341 | 1035 |
| registers / timing / contention / transfers | 264 | 341 | 97 | 341 | 1043 |
| flags | 139 | 179 | 57 | 179 | 554 |
| memory | 14 | 150 | 20 | 144 | 328 |

Three things decide the order of work:

1. **`DD`/`FD` are 684 vectors — 65% of M2 — and carry 294 of the 328 memory failures.** That
   concentration *is* the `(IX+d)` displacement path. The resolved-target refactor is therefore
   not housekeeping: it pays for two thirds of the corpus, and it goes first.
2. **Two `DD` vectors already pass** — `dd00` and `ddfd00`, both prefix-chain cases. The rule that
   each prefix is its own instruction with its own `R` increment is already correct.
3. **Eight `ED` vectors fail with no fault recorded** — `edb0`–`edb3`, `edb8`–`edbb`, i.e.
   `LDIR`/`CPIR`/`INIR`/`OTIR` and their decrementing twins. They are the only `ED` work that is
   not uniform decode, because they repeat. The harness's `MAX_STEPS_PER_VECTOR = 64` is
   comfortable at M1 (the longest is 17) and must be re-derived when they land, rather than
   discovered as a spurious step-limit failure.

The traps themselves are catalogued in [`Z80-REFERENCE.md`](Z80-REFERENCE.md): `DDCB`/`FDCB` put
the displacement byte *before* the opcode, prefix chains each cost their own M1 fetch and `R`
increment, and the `HL`→`IX`/`IY` substitution is asymmetric.

**One gap to close first: the harness has never been reviewed by anyone but its author.** The cold
review deliberately scoped `crates/z80/tests/` out, so the code that decides whether the core is
correct has had no independent eye. That is the wrong asymmetry to carry into M2, where the
harness grows a repeat mechanism and a new step cap.
